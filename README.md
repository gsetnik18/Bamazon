# unit-10-bamazon
Repo for Bamazon app

This app uses the inquirer package to accept inputs from customers. These inputs are used to query a MySQL database, to check for inventory and cost, and either allows the user to "purchase" items, or notifies them that the item is not in stock, or that there is an insufficient quantity of the item.
